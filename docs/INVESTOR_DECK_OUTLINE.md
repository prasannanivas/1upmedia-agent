### INTERNAL NOTES ON TRANSPARENCY APPROACH:

This investor presentation will include Tier 1 (public) parameters plus selected Tier 2 (regulatory) parameters where appropriate to demonstrate methodology robustness. The following elements will be included with appropriate context:

- Recovery rates (with methodological justification)
- Content lifespan estimates (with industry benchmarking)
- Default content cost estimates (with market validation)
- Present value calculation methodology (with academic references)

The following Tier 3 (proprietary) elements will be discussed conceptually but without revealing specific values:

- Click loss multipliers (discuss existence but not values)
- Psychological mismatch assessment approach (without thresholds)
- Cannibalization detection methodology (without specific coefficients)
- Risk bucketing approach (without threshold values)

This approach balances demonstrating our competitive advantage while protecting core IP. All investor discussions should be covered by appropriate confidentiality agreements.
