# Enhanced Keyword Efficiency Index (DA vs KD) - Documentation

## Overview

The Keyword Efficiency Index has been perfected using standard SEO measures to provide accurate assessment of keyword targeting effectiveness against domain authority capabilities.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Keyword Difficulty (KD) Calculation

- **Previous**: Simple position-based estimation
- **New**: Multi-factor KD estimation using:
  - Position (primary factor: position × 0.8)
  - Search volume (impressions indicate competitiveness)
  - CTR performance (lower CTR often indicates higher difficulty)
  - Range: 10-90 (industry standard)

### 2. Blended Authority Score

- **Formula**: `BA = (Domain Authority × 0.6) + (Page Authority × 0.4)`
- **Industry Standard**: Weighted combination providing realistic targeting capability
- **Range**: 0-100

### 3. Efficiency Ratio

- **Formula**: `Efficiency Ratio = Blended Authority ÷ Average KD`
- **Interpretation**:
  - `> 1.2`: Excellent targeting (under-utilizing authority)
  - `0.8 - 1.2`: Good balance
  - `0.6 - 0.8`: Moderate overreach (warning)
  - `< 0.6`: High overreach (critical)

### 4. Competitiveness Index

- **Formula**: `(Average Impressions ÷ 1000) × (Average Position ÷ 10)`
- **Range**: 1-10
- **Purpose**: Indicates market competitiveness for targeted keywords

### 5. Opportunity Score

- **Formula**: `100 - KD Gap - Position Penalty`
- **Factors**:
  - KD Gap: `max(0, avgKD - blendedAuthority)`
  - Position Penalty: `max(0, avgPosition - 20) × 2`
- **Range**: 0-100 (higher = better opportunity)

### 6. Risk Level Assessment

- **Critical**: KD Gap > 30 (targeting keywords way above capability)
- **High**: KD Gap > 15 (significant overreach)
- **Medium**: KD Gap > 5 (moderate overreach)
- **Low**: KD Gap ≤ 5 (good alignment)

## Performance Metrics

### Keyword Distribution Analysis

- **Top 10 Keywords**: Ranking in positions 1-10
- **Top 20 Keywords**: Ranking in positions 11-20
- **Beyond Page 2**: Ranking in positions 21+

### Overexertion Detection

- Identifies pages ranking beyond position 30
- Calculates estimated KD using enhanced formula
- Shows authority gap for each overexertion
- Provides specific URL-level recommendations

## Strategic Recommendations

### Authority Building Focus (KD Gap > 20)

- Focus on high-quality backlink acquisition
- Target lower difficulty keywords below blended authority
- Prioritize domain-wide authority improvements

### Balanced Approach (KD Gap 10-20)

- Mix of authority building and keyword optimization
- Content quality improvements for existing rankings
- Strategic keyword selection within capability range

### Optimization Focus (KD Gap 0-10)

- Fine-tune existing keyword strategy
- Optimize on-page factors for better positions
- Consider targeting slightly higher KD keywords

### Expansion Opportunity (KD Gap < 0)

- Authority exceeds current targeting difficulty
- Opportunity to target higher KD keywords
- Scale content strategy upward
