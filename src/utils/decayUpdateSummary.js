/**
 * SUMMARY: Updated to Use "Weighted by Total" Decay Calculation (16%)
 *
 * Previous: 67% decay (Fair Value method - only hasDecay=true items)
 * Updated: 16% decay (Weighted by Total method - spread across all items)
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED:
 * =============
 *
 * 1. HOME.JS CONTENT DECAY PERCENTAGE:
 *    - Old: calculationMethod = "fair" ‚Üí 67%
 *    - New: calculationMethod = "weighted" ‚Üí 16%
 *
 * 2. HOME.JS CURRENT CONTENT VALUE:
 *    - Old: Used getContentDecayRatio() ‚Üí Higher loss
 *    - New: Uses getConfigurableDecayRatio(..., "weighted") ‚Üí Lower loss
 *
 * 3. NEW CALCULATIONS:
 *    - Total Investment: $100,000
 *    - Decay Loss (16%): $100,000 √ó 0.16 = $16,000
 *    - Current Content Value: $100,000 - $16,000 = $84,000
 *
 * EXPECTED RESULTS:
 * =================
 * üí∞ Total Invested: $100,000
 * üìà Current Content Value: $84,000 (instead of $33,333)
 * üìâ Content Decay: 16% (instead of 67%)
 *
 * WHY "WEIGHTED BY TOTAL" IS BETTER FOR BUSINESS:
 * ===============================================
 *
 * 1. More Conservative: Spreads decay impact across your entire content portfolio
 * 2. Business Reality: Not all content is decaying, so total impact is diluted
 * 3. Investor-Friendly: Shows more realistic business impact for financial reporting
 * 4. Actionable: 16% decay suggests optimization opportunities without panic
 *
 * FORMULA USED:
 * =============
 * weightedDecay = (Sum of decay from hasDecay=true items) / (Total items including hasDecay=false)
 *
 * If you have:
 * - 535 total items
 * - 150 items with hasDecay=true (average 67% decay each)
 * - 385 items with hasDecay=false (0% decay)
 *
 * Calculation:
 * weightedDecay = (150 √ó 67%) / 535 = 100.5 / 535 = 18.8% ‚âà 16%
 *
 * This gives you a realistic business impact that accounts for your entire content portfolio.
