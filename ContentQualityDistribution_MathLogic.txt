## 1. Inputs and Initial Checks
- **averageOrderValue (AOV):** From calculations or onboarding data.
- **totalContentCost:** From calculations or onboarding data.
- **conversionRate:** Fixed at 2% (0.02).
- **totalUniqueUrls:** Number of unique URLs (from contentCostWaste array).
- **costPerUrl:** `totalContentCost / totalUniqueUrls`

---

## 2. Quality Categories
- Defines 5 categories: Excellent (90-100), Good (75-89), Average (60-74), Poor (40-59), Critical (0-39).
- Each URL is assigned a quality score and placed in a category.

---

## 3. Quality Score Calculation (Per URL)
- Each URL starts at 100 points.
- Penalties are subtracted for each issue:
  - **Decay Penalty:** If the URL has decay, a penalty is applied based on severity.
  - **Mismatch Penalty:** If the URL has a keyword mismatch, a penalty is applied based on severity.
  - **Cannibalization Penalty:** If the URL is involved in cannibalization, a penalty is applied based on severity.
  - **Dilution Penalty:** If the URL has link dilution, a penalty is applied based on severity.
- **Minimum score is 0.**

## 4. Revenue Loss Calculation (Per URL)
- For each issue, a revenue loss is estimated and summed for the URL.
- **totalRevenueLoss:** Sum of all revenue losses across URLs.

---

## 5. Distribution and Grading
- Calculates the count and percentage of URLs in each quality category.
- Maps categories to A-D grades:
  - A: Excellent
  - B: Good
  - C: Average
  - D: Poor + Critical
- Calculates grade distribution and percentages.

---

## 6. Output
- Returns a summary with:
  - Total URLs analyzed
  - Average quality score
  - Total revenue loss
  - Quality grade (A-D)
  - Cost per URL
  - Distribution and grade breakdowns
  - Lists of worst and best performers
